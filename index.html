                Hello! My name is Max Wilets and I made this page with only html, CSS,
                and Javascript! I was born in Sandy, Utah. I graduated from the
                University of Utah with a BS in Geography. I also attended a coding
                bootcamp at the University of Utah where I will be a teaching
                assistant of my own cohort
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies include skateboarding, making music, and playing table top
                board games.

            <h2>Things that Make me nervous</h2>
            <p class="colText">
                I get nervous in large crowds and and prefer more smaller more
                intimate situations that are less chaotic. I also get anxious when I
                order packages because I can't wait for them to arrive!

            <h2>Greatest Developer Moment</h2>
            <p class="colText">
                My greatest developer moment was working on the East High Support
                project. It was very rewarding to spend so much time and produce
                something that made a positive impact to the community.

            <h2>Favorite Pop Culture Moment</h2>
            <p class="colText">
                My favorite pop culture moment is when Tony Hawk did the 900 for 
                the first time. It was a moment that changed skateboard forever resulting
                in larger coverage from the media and a skateboarding video game franchise.
                Also the Avengers Infinity War and End Game was an amazing culmination of 
                10+ years of comic book movies.
